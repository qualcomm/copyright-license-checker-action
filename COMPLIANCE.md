# Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This GitHub Action enforces copyright and license compliance for code changes in pull requests. It analyzes the diff/patch to ensure that all modifications adhere to the repository's licensing policies and copyright requirements.

**Action Repository**: https://github.com/qualcomm/copyright-license-checker-action

## Build Blocking Scenarios

The following scenarios will **BLOCK** your build and require remediation before the PR can be merged:

### 1. Incompatible License Added

**What triggers this:**
- Adding code with a license that is not in the repository's allowed license list
- Introducing code under GPL, AGPL, or other copyleft licenses when the repository uses permissive licenses (BSD, MIT, Apache)
- Adding proprietary or restrictive licenses

**Example:**
```
🚨 BLOCKING ERROR:
📄 File: src/new_module.c
🚨 License issues detected:
  - Incompatible license added: GPL-2.0-only
```

**How to fix:**
- Remove the incompatible code
- Replace with code under a compatible license
- Obtain permission to relicense the code
- Add the license to the allowed list if it's actually compatible (requires approval)

**Compliance Impact:** HIGH - Mixing incompatible licenses can create legal issues and licensing conflicts

---

### 2. License Deletion Without Replacement

**What triggers this:**
- Removing license headers from existing files
- Deleting license statements without adding new ones
- Modifying files in a way that removes license information

**Example:**
```
🚨 BLOCKING ERROR:
📄 File: src/utils.py
🚨 License issues detected:
  - License deleted: BSD-3-Clause-Clear
```

**How to fix:**
- Restore the original license header
- Add an appropriate license header if it was missing
- Ensure license information is preserved during refactoring

**Compliance Impact:** HIGH - Removing license information can violate licensing terms and create legal ambiguity

---

### 3. License Change (Modification)

**What triggers this:**
- Changing the license of existing code from one license to another
- Replacing license headers with different licenses
- Modifying license terms

**Example:**
```
🚨 BLOCKING ERROR:
📄 File: src/core.cpp
🚨 License issues detected:
  - License deleted: MIT and license added: Apache-2.0
```

**How to fix:**
- Revert to the original license
- Obtain proper authorization for license changes
- Document the reason for license change if legitimate
- Ensure all copyright holders agree to the license change

**Compliance Impact:** CRITICAL - Changing licenses without proper authorization can violate copyright law

---

### 4. Missing License on New Source Files

**What triggers this:**
- Adding new source code files without license headers
- Creating new modules without proper licensing information

**Supported source file extensions:**
```
.c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .java, .py, .js, .ts, .rb, .go, .swift, .kt, .kts, .sh
```

**Example:**
```
🚨 BLOCKING ERROR:
📄 File: src/new_feature.py
🚨 License issues detected:
  - No license added for source file: src/new_feature.py
```

**How to fix:**
- Add appropriate license header to the file
- Use the repository's standard license template
- Include SPDX identifier for clarity


**Compliance Impact:** MEDIUM - New code without licenses creates ambiguity about usage rights

---

### 5. Copyright Deletion

**What triggers this:**
- Removing copyright statements from existing code
- Deleting copyright holder information
- Modifying copyright notices inappropriately

**Example:**
```
🚨 BLOCKING ERROR:
📄 File: src/algorithm.c
⚠️ Copyright issues detected:
  - Copyright deletions detected: ['Copyright (c) 2024 Original Author']
```

**How to fix:**
- Restore the original copyright statement
- Add your copyright in addition to (not replacing) existing copyrights
- Follow the pattern: keep old copyrights, add new ones

**Allowed Exception:**
The action allows the following copyright transition:
- FROM: "Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc. All rights"
- TO: "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries"

**Compliance Impact:** HIGH - Removing copyright notices can violate copyright law and attribution requirements

---

## Non-Blocking Warnings

The following scenarios generate **WARNINGS** but do NOT block the build:

### Uncertain/Unknown License Detection

**What triggers this:**
- Scancode detects uncertain or unknown license patterns
- Any license identifier containing `LicenseRef-scancode-unknown` (e.g., `LicenseRef-scancode-unknown`, `LicenseRef-scancode-unknown-license-reference`, etc.)
- Ambiguous license text that scancode cannot confidently identify

**How it works:**
The action uses generic pattern matching to identify uncertain licenses. Any license containing the pattern `LicenseRef-scancode-unknown` is automatically treated as a warning rather than a blocking error. This catches all current and future scancode unknown license variants without requiring manual updates to the code.

**Example:**
```
⚠️ WARNINGS (Non-blocking):
📄 File: src/vendor/third_party.c
⚠️ License warnings:
  - Incompatible license added: LicenseRef-scancode-unknown-license-reference
```

**What to do:**
- Manually review the file to identify the actual license
- Add proper license headers if missing or unclear
- Update the code to use clear, standard SPDX license identifiers
- Consider adding the file to `.licenseignore` if it's a known false positive or vendored dependency
- If the license is genuinely unknown, work with the code owner to clarify licensing

**Why this is a warning, not an error:**
Scancode may flag licenses as "unknown" due to:
- Non-standard license formatting
- Partial or truncated license text
- Custom license variations
- Detection algorithm limitations

These cases require human review but shouldn't automatically block development, as they may be false positives or require clarification rather than immediate remediation.

**Compliance Impact:** LOW - Requires manual review but doesn't block development. However, unresolved unknown licenses should be addressed before production release.

## License Categories

### Permissive Licenses (Generally Allowed)
```
BSD-3-Clause, MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause-Clear, ISC, CC0-1.0, Zlib
```

### Copyleft Licenses (Restricted)
```
GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0
```

**Note:** The specific allowed licenses depend on your repository's configuration in `scanner/config.py`

---

## Best Practices for Compliance

### 1. Always Include License Headers
Every source file should have a clear license header:

**Example:**
```
Copyright (c) Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.
SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause-Clear
```

### 2. Preserve Existing Copyrights
When modifying files:
- Keep all existing copyright statements
- Add your copyright below existing ones
- Never remove or modify existing copyright holders

### 3. Use Standard License Identifiers
- Use SPDX identifiers for clarity
- Avoid custom or ambiguous license text
- Reference standard license texts

### 4. Document Third-Party Code
- Clearly mark third-party code
- Include original license information
- Consider using `.licenseignore` for vendored dependencies

### 5. Review Before Committing
- Check license headers before committing
- Verify copyright statements are accurate
- Run the action locally if possible

---

## Exemptions and Overrides

### Using .licenseignore

Create a `.licenseignore` file at the repository root to exclude files from license checks:

```
# Ignore vendored dependencies
vendor/**
third_party/**

# Ignore generated files
*.generated.js
build/**

# Ignore test fixtures
tests/fixtures/**
```

**Use with caution:** Only ignore files where license checking is not applicable or creates false positives.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Blocked - What to Do?

1. **Read the error message carefully** - It tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check the specific file** mentioned in the error
3. **Review the compliance scenario** that matches your error
4. **Apply the recommended fix**
5. **Test locally** if possible before pushing

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Removing license headers during refactoring**
✅ Preserve all license information when restructuring code

❌ **Copying code without preserving licenses**
✅ Always maintain original license and copyright information

❌ **Adding GPL code to BSD-licensed projects**
✅ Verify license compatibility before adding third-party code

❌ **Forgetting license headers on new files**
✅ Use templates or IDE snippets to add headers automatically

## Contact and Support

For questions about license compliance or to request exemptions:
- Review your organization's open source compliance policies
- Consult with your legal team for complex licensing questions
- File an issue in the action repository for technical problems
